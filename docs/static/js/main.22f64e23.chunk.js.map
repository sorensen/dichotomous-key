This is a dichotomous key meant to help you identify the Order of the insect you’ve found.\n            Each page will present you with 2 choices. Pick the one that matches your bug the best.\n            If you pick the one you think is right, but the next one doesn’t seem right, that’s okay!\n            Just go back and try again.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Along the way there will be help. Any words that are __COLOR__ will give you a definition to\n            explain what that word means. Other words that are __COLOR__ will provide a picture to give\n            you a better idea of what you are supposed to be seeing. These pictures may have multiple\n            descriptions from the key, and sometimes will tell you what the bug is, so click on them\n            as often as you need to! When you get to the Order page, you will get a description of that\n            order, and maybe even some pictures, if your choices led you to specific bugs in that order.\n            Don’t forget to click on them!\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This key will only get you to the Order of the bug you find. That means that you will\n            have a very general idea of where your bug belongs. If you want more information or\n            help with identification, check the link to the Resources page in the menu. Figuring\n            out the family, genus, and even species will help you get the exact right bug.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Some of the questions in the key require you to get up close and personal with your bug.\n            The easiest way to do this is to put the bug to sleep or to kill it. The most humane way\n            to kill an insect is by freezing. Place the bug in a jar and put it in the freezer overnight.\n            If you only want to make it sleepy, put it in the freezer for 15 minutes to half an hour.\n            Check your bug to make sure it’s slowed down or isn’t moving before you remove it from the freezer.\n            There is still a risk of it freezing to death, but it’s not a bad way to go. Some of the\n            questions may require a magnifying glass, but few will require a microscope. If you have access\n            to a dissecting scope you are well on your way to being an entomologist!

Mecopterans are holometabolous, which means the larvae don’t look anything like the adults, and there is a pupal stage between the larval and adult stages.`,\n                                          },\n                                        ],\n                                      },\n                                    ],\n                                  },\n                                ],\n                              },\n                              {\n                                title: `Tarsi with 4 or fewer segments`,\n                                key: `fewer-segments`,\n                                items: [\n                                  {\n                                    title: `Hind wings as long as front wings and of same shape or wider at base; wings at rest held above the body or outstretched (never held flat over abdomen); wings with many veins and cells; antennae short, bristlelike, inconspicuous; abdomen long, slender; tarsi 3-segmented; length 20-85mm`,\n                                    key: `even-wings`,\n                                    answer: `Order Odonota (Dragonflies and Damselflies)`,\n                                    summary: `Dragonflies and damselflies look a lot alike.

Springtails are ametabolous, which means they just eventually molt into the adult stage.`,\n                                              },\n                                            ],\n                                          },\n                                          {\n                                            title: `Mouthparts usually distinct, mandibulate or haustellate; abdomen without appendages such as described in preceding entry; size variable`,\n                                            key: `mouth-distinct`,\n                                            items: [\n                                              {\n                                                title: `Body larviform, thorax and abdomen not differentiated; compound eyes present`,\n                                                key: `larviform`,\n                                                answer: `Order Coleoptera (Specifically Larviform Beetles)`,\n                                                summary: `There are a few genera of beetles where the adult female looks like a larva.

The pincers of males tend to be more curved, but both males and females can use their pincers for tasks such as grabbing things and defense. Earwigs have membranous hindwings that are thin, and have to be folded to fit under their forewings, which are short and leathery. The earwigs use their pincers to help fold up the wings! Most earwigs can fly with their hindwings, but it doesn’t happen very often (at least when a human is watching!). Earwigs are mostly omnivorous scavengers, but some are predators. They move around mostly at night, and are considered pests by most people because they include garden plants in their diets. Earwigs are good at hiding under things since they are flattened, so during the day they squeeze into tight spaces. Dermapterans are hemimetabolous, which means the young ones (called nymphs) look like the adults, but the adults have wings. Earwigs are just as likely to crawl in your ear as any other insect (which is highly unlikely), so don’t worry!`,\n                                                              },\n                                                            ],\n                                                          },\n                                                          {\n                                                            title: `Cerci absent or, if present, not forcepslike; tarsi variable`,\n                                                            key: `not-forcepslike`,\n                                                            items: [\n                                                              {\n                                                                title: `Tarsi 3-segmented, basal segment of front tarsi enlarged`,\n                                                                key: `three-segments`,\n                                                                answer: `Order Embiidina (Webspinners)`,\n                                                                summary: `Webspinners use the silk they spin to make “galleries” that they live in.

Although you may think of the jumping insects when you think of crickets, mole crickets are also orthopterans. Mole crickets have front legs that are adapted for digging, and live underground.

Termites are “eusocial” insects, and live in large colonies. The term eusocial means that the castes (workers, soldiers, kings, and queens) all look different, even if they’re the same species. It also means that they take care of their young, and defend their colonies (among other things!). Termites eat cellulose, so that means that they often eat wood, but it can also be other types of plant material. Termites are actually very important for ecosystems, even though they are considered pests when they’re in our houses. Some termites make nests, and some live underground in mounds. But they’ll always be found in warm areas, because they are considered “soft” bodied, which means they freeze easily.

The larvae will then molt to a grub that looks more typical of beetle larvae.`,\n                                                                      },\n                                                                    ],\n                                                                  },\n                                                                ],\n                                                              },\n                                                            ],\n                                                          },\n                                                        ],\n                                                      },\n                                                    ],\n                                                  },\n                                                ],\n                                              },\n                                            ],\n                                          },\n                                        ],\n                                      },\n                                    ],\n                                  },\n                                ],\n                              },\n                            ],\n                          },\n                        ],\n                      },\n                    ],\n                  },\n                ],\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            title: `Body more or less wormlike, body regions (except possibly head) not well differentiated, segmented thoracic legs absent; antennae present or absent (larvae and some adults)`,\n            key: `wormlike`,\n            items: [\n              {\n                title: `Aquatic`,\n                key: `aquatic`,\n                answer: `Order Diptera (Specifically Aquatic Larvae of Flies)`,\n                summary: `There are several families of Diptera that have aquatic larvae, such as crane flies and mosquitoes.
