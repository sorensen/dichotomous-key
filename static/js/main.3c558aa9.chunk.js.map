Pick the one that matches your bug the best.\n            If you pick the one you think is right, but the next one doesn’t seem right, that’s okay!\n            Just go back and try again.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Along the way there will be help.

Figuring\n            out the family, genus, and even species will help you get the exact right bug.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Some of the questions in the key require you to get up close and personal with your bug.\n            The easiest way to do this is to put the bug to sleep or to kill it. The most humane way\n            to kill an insect is by freezing. Place the bug in a jar and put it in the freezer overnight.\n            If you only want to make it sleepy, put it in the freezer for 15 minutes to half an hour.\n            Check your bug to make sure it’s slowed down or isn’t moving before you remove it from the freezer.\n            There is still a risk of it freezing to death, but it’s not a bad way to go. Some of the\n            questions may require a magnifying glass, but few will require a microscope. If you have access\n            to a dissecting scope you are well on your way to being an entomologist!

Earwigs have membranous hindwings that are thin, and have to be folded to fit under their forewings, which are short and leathery. The earwigs use their pincers to help fold up the wings! Most earwigs can fly with their hindwings, but it doesn’t happen very often (at least when a human is watching!). Earwigs are mostly omnivorous scavengers, but some are predators. They move around mostly at night, and are considered pests by most people because they include garden plants in their diets. Earwigs are good at hiding under things since they are flattened, so during the day they squeeze into tight spaces.

Only some ants are considered pests to humans, and that’s usually because they like to get in our houses and eat our food. Some species of ants may have small colonies, but other species live in huge colonies, with millions of ants in them. Ants are usually “eusocial,” which means that the castes (workers, soldiers, drones, and queens) all look different, even if they’re the same species. It also means that they take care of their young, and defend their colonies (among other things!). Did you know there were wingless wasps? They are easy to mistake for ants, so look closely at the antennae. Wasps don’t have elbowed antennae, but they still sting, so look out! Most wingless wasps are not aggressive, though, and will only sting if they are being crushed. Hymenoptera are holometabolous, which means the larvae don’t look anything like the adults, and there is a pupal stage between the larval and adult stages.`,\n                              },\n                              {\n                                title: `Abdomen not particularly constricted at base; antennae not elbowed; tarsi variable`,\n                                key: `abdomen`,\n                                items: [\n                                  {\n                                    title: `Abdomen with 3 caudal filaments that are long and threadlike, and with stylelike appendages on some abdominal segments; mouthparts mandibulate, but often more or less retracted into head; body nearly always covered with scales; terrestrial`,\n                                    key: `three-caudal`,\n                                    items: [\n                                      {\n                                        title: `Compound eyes large, usually contiguous; body somewhat cylindrical, with thorax arched; ocelli present; middle and hind coxae nearly always with styli; abdominal styli on segments 2-9`,\n                                        key: `large-eyes`,\n                                        answer: `Order Microcoryphia (Bristletails)`,\n                                        summary: `Bristletails live in a lot of different places.

The forewings of cockroaches are called tegmina, and are leathery, but not necessarily hard. Cockroaches eat just about anything with their chewing mouthparts. Many cockroaches live on land, but some are aquatic. Regardless of wet or dry, cockroaches live on every continent (even Antarctica!). Cockroaches are hemimetabolous, which means the young ones (called nymphs) look like the adults, but the adults have wings.`,\n                                                                      },\n                                                                      {\n                                                                        title: `Body elongate and cylindrical, head not concealed from above by pronotum; ocelli absent; US Northwest and western Canada`,\n                                                                        key: `elongate`,\n                                                                        answer: `Order Grylloblattodea (Ice Crawlers; Rare)`,\n                                                                        summary: `Ice crawlers live exactly where their name says: in the ice: they can be found on mountaintops and the edges of glaciers.

Earwigs have membranous hindwings that are thin, and have to be folded to fit under their forewings, which are short and leathery. The earwigs use their pincers to help fold up the wings! Most earwigs can fly with their hindwings, but it doesn’t happen very often (at least when a human is watching!). Earwigs are mostly omnivorous scavengers, but some are predators. They move around mostly at night, and are considered pests by most people because they include garden plants in their diets.

Termites are “eusocial” insects, and live in large colonies. The term eusocial means that the castes (workers, soldiers, kings, and queens) all look different, even if they’re the same species. It also means that they take care of their young, and defend their colonies (among other things!). Termites eat cellulose, so that means that they often eat wood, but it can also be other types of plant material. Termites are actually very important for ecosystems, even though they are considered pests when they’re in our houses. Some termites make nests, and some live underground in mounds. But they’ll always be found in warm areas, because they are considered “soft” bodied, which means they freeze easily. Isoptera are hemimetabolous, which means the young ones (called nymphs) look like the adults, but the adults have wings.

They are hemimetabolous, which means the young ones (called nymphs) look like the adults, but the adults have wings.`,\n                                                                          },\n                                                                        ],\n                                                                      },\n                                                                    ],\n                                                                  },\n                                                                ],\n                                                              },\n                                                            ],\n                                                          },\n                                                        ],\n                                                      },\n                                                    ],\n                                                  },\n                                                  {\n                                                    title: `Compound eyes and wing pads absent; body usually wormlike in shape (larvae)`,\n                                                    key: `compound-eyes`,\n                                                    items: [\n                                                      {\n                                                        title: `Ventral prolegs present on 2 or more abdominal segments`,\n                                                        key: `ventral`,\n                                                        items: [\n                                                          {\n                                                            title: `With 5 pairs of prolegs (on abdominal segments 3-6 and 10) or fewer, prolegs with tiny hooks (crochets); several (usually 6) stemmata on each side of head`,\n                                                            key: `five-pairs`,\n                                                            answer: `Order Lepidoptera (Specifically Caterpillars/Larvae of Moths and Butterflies)`,\n                                                            summary: `The larvae of insects in the order Lepidoptera are commonly called caterpillars.

Many lepidopteran larvae are considered pests, not only because of what they eat, but because they eat a lot! Lepidopteran larvae have soft bodies, and come in many shapes and sizes. Some are brightly colored or have ornamentations (like spines) to warn predators away from them. Others are dull colored or may be mottled to blend in with their environment. Most of the time the butterfly or moth that comes from a caterpillar looks completely different than the coloring would suggest.
