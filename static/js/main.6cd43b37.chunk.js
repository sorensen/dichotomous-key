However, there is a family in this order that mimics leaves too! This stick or leaf mimicry is excellent camouflage against predators, and some of the insects have extra outgrowths that make them even more convincing as plants. In addition to their natural camouflage, phasmids may have spines on their legs to harm predators, glands that release chemicals to drive predators away or hurt them if it gets in the predators\u2019 mouths, or brightly colored wings to startle predators. Phasmids themselves are herbivores, and some are considered pests because they eat leaves and can damage trees. Not all of the Phasmids can fly, which isn\u2019t surprising because some of them can get up to almost 2 feet long.
